= Vert.x Metrics Examples

Vert.x core provides a Service Provide Interface (SPI) for collecting metrics. The Dropwizard implementation
collects these metrics in a Dropwizard registry that can be used for reporting in other system or can
be queried via the Dropwizard MetricsService.

The dashboard uses the vertx-web eventbus bridge to push metrics periodically on the event bus. The metrics
are retrieved from the MetricsService in Json format.
